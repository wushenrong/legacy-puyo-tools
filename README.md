# Legacy Puyo Tools

Supports Puyo Puyo 7 and possibly Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary `mtx` and `fpd`
files. Puyo Puyo!! 20th Anniversary is still not supported yet. (Create an issue
or pull request to support `fnt` and additional `mtx` controls). Also, legacy as
in older Puyo Puyo games, not that this tool is decapitated.

## Why

The [Puyo Text Editor][1] can already do what Legacy Puyo Tools does and is the
inspiration of this tool, but there are advantages to rewrite it in Python:

- Better cross compatibility with Linux.
- Don't have to update the language version every time it becomes End of Life.
- Avoids the rigidness of using a pure object-oriented design.
