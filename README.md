# Legacy Puyo Tools

A tool to convert `fpd` and `mtx` files used by the Puyo games. Tested with Puyo
Puyo 7, possibly works with Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary, but *not* Puyo Puyo!!
20th Anniversary (Create an issue or pull request to support `fnt` and
additional `mtx` controls). Also, legacy as in older Puyo Puyo games, not that
this tool is decapitated.

## Why

The [Puyo Text Editor](https://github.com/nickworonekin/puyo-text-editor) can
already do what Legacy Puyo Tools does and is the inspiration of this tool, but
there are advantages to rewrite it in Python:

- Better cross compatibility with Linux.
- Don't have to update the language version every time it becomes End of Life.
- Avoids the rigidness of using a pure object-oriented design.
